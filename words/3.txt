Recent studies show that particular intraocular lens characteristics 
can contribute to lens dislocation after the surgery 
Moreover, the expert surgeons argue that there can be a direct relationship 
between the overall time of lens unfolding and the risk of
lens relocation after the surgery 
Some surgeons also hypothesize that severe lens instability during the 
surgery is a symptom of lens relocation 
To discover the potential correlations between lens relocation and its 
possibly contributing factors surgeons require a tool for systematic feature extraction 
Indeed, an automatic approach is required for (i) detecting the lens 
implantation phase to determine the starting time for lens statistics’ 
computation and (ii) segmenting the lens and pupil to compute the lens 
statistics over time 
The irregularity-related statistics can afterward be extracted by tracking 
the lens’s relative size (normalized by the pupil’s size) and relative 
movements (by calibrating the pupil) 
Due to the dearth of computing power in the operation rooms, automatic 
phase detection and lens/pupil segmentation on the fly is not currently achievable 
Alternatively, this analysis can be performed in a post hoc manner 
using recorded cataract surgery videos
