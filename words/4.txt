Abstract A critical complication after cataract surgery is the dislocation of the
lens implant leading to vision deterioration and eye trauma 
In order to reduce the risk of this complication 
it is vital to discover the risk factors during the
surgery 
However studying the relationship between lens dislocation and its sus-
picious risk factors 
using numerous videos is a time-extensive procedure 
Hence the surgeons demand an automatic approach to enable a larger-scale and 
accordingly more reliable study 
In this paper we propose a novel framework as the major step 
towards lens irregularity detection. 
In particular, we propose (I) an end-to-end recurrent neural network to recognize 
the lens-implantation phase and
(II) a novel semantic segmentation network to segment the lens and pupil after
the implantation phase. The phase recognition results reveal the effectiveness of
the proposed surgical phase recognition approach 
Moreover, the segmentation results confirm the proposed segmentation networkâ€™s 
effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art rival approaches
